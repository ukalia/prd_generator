# PRD Generator – AI-powered Product Requirement Document Generator using Local LLMs

## Overview

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a local Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically generate high-quality Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) from raw business input (BRDs, user stories, or simple textual descriptions).

The system supports `.docx` files as input (e.g., business requirement documents or meeting notes) and outputs structured, markdown-formatted PRDs that can also be saved as `.docx`.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language
- **Ollama** – Runs local LLMs like Mistral or LLaMA
- **ChromaDB** – Vector store for document retrieval in RAG

---

## Features

-  **RAG-Powered Prompting**: Retrieves relevant past PRD examples from a vector store to guide generation  
-  **Local LLM Inference**: Uses Ollama to run models like `mistral`, no API keys or cloud access needed  
-  **Structured PRD Output**: Includes sections like Overview, Goals, Requirements, Use Cases, and more  
-  **`.docx` Output Support**: Formats output with real Word styling (headings, bullets, page breaks)  
-  **Extensible Input Support**: Currently supports `.docx` BRDs but easily extendable to `.pdf`, `.txt`, or web input

##  Sample Use Case

- Input: `sample_brd.docx`  
- Output: `generated_prd.docx` with sections like Overview, Goals, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria
